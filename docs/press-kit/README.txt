# Introducing DisplayBuddy

DisplayBuddy lets you control external displays connected to your Mac right from your menu bar! No need to touch those clunky monitor buttons! It has been tested on a wide range of monitors from manufacturers such as Dell, Acer, LG, Samsung, BenQ & PRISM, and works with most displays manufactured in the last 5 years. DisplayBuddy can also control the volume for monitors with built-in speakers. If DisplayBuddy doesn't work as expected for you, you can refund your purchase within 7 days.

# Features

- Control your monitorâ€™s brightness & contrast directly from your Mac menu bar.

- Effortlessly manage multiple displays with ease.
- Save settings across multiple displays as Presets, and activate them later with a single click!
- Looks great in both Light & Dark modes.
- Supports macOS 10.13+ (High Sierra)
